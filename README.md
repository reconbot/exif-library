# @reconbot/exif-library

A nice fork of [exif-library](https://github.com/hMatoba/exif-library) for my own uses. I've dropped browser support and changed the api and migrated to my own build system.

[![Release](https://github.com/reconbot/exif-library/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/reconbot/exif-library/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Guide

- Set the repo secret `NPM_TOKEN` before your first push so that you can publish to npm.
